# How to load data into your PgSQL?


```bash
tmux new -s mimic_iv

```

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql-client -y
```

```bash
make up
```

### Password pass

```bash
cp .pgpass ~/.pgpass
```

### Create table and load data all in one
```bash
./scripts/load_mimiciv_data.sh
```


### attach tmux

```bash
tmux a -t mimic_iv
```

### exit

```
Control+b d
```


## Navigating this repository

This repository contains code for five databases on PhysioNet:

- [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/) - critical care data for patients admitted to ICUs at the BIDMC between 2001 - 2012
- [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/) - hospital and critical care data for patients admitted to the ED or ICU between 2008 - 2019
- [MIMIC-IV-ED](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ed/) - emergency department data for individuals attending the ED between 2011 - 2019
- MIMIC-IV Waveforms (TBD) - this dataset has yet to be published.
- [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/) - chest x-ray imaging and deidentified free-text radiology reports for patients admitted to the ED from 2012 - 2016

The repository contains one top-level folder containing community developed code for each datasets:

- [mimic-iii](/mimic-iii) - build scripts for MIMIC-III, derived concepts which are available on the `physionet-data.mimiciii_derived` dataset on BigQuery, and tutorials.
- [mimic-iv](/mimic-iv) - build scripts for MIMIC-IV, derived concepts which are available on the `physionet-data.mimic_derived` dataset on BigQuery, and tutorials.
- [mimic-iv-cxr](/mimic-iv-cxr) - code for loading and analyzing both dicom (mimic-iv-cxr/dcm) and text (mimic-iv-cxr/txt) data. In order to clearly indicate that MIMIC-CXR can be linked with MIMIC-IV, we have named this folder mimic-iv-cxr, and any references to MIMIC-CXR / MIMIC-IV-CXR are interchangeable.
- [mimic-iv-ed](/mimic-iv-ed) - build scripts for MIMIC-IV-ED.
- mimic-iv-waveforms - TBD

Each subfolder has a README with further detail regarding its content.
